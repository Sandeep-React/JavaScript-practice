// Object Oriented Programming Language
/* OOPs in Java Script
--------------------------
Prototype -- like a class contain some method
From this prototype we create an Object and can access the methods

Prototypal inheritance
-----------------------
The prototype contains methods tht are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype;
Behavior is delegated to the linked prototype object.

3 ways to implement the prototypal inheritance
----------------------------------------------
1) Constructor function
    Technique to create objects from a function
    This is how built in objects like Arrays, maps or sets are actually implemented.

2) ES6 classes
    Modern alternative to connect function syntax
    "Syntactic sugar" : behind the screen, ES6 classes works like constructor function.
    ES6 classes do  not behave like classes in " CLASSICAL OOP"

3) Object.create()
    The easiest and the most straightforward way of linking an object to prototype
