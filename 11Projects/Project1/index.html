<p>Project - 4
    Create a lorem-ipsum generator, as shown in the screenshot. There should be a range slider and a number text field in it. 
    Both should be connected, meaning if I increase the range slider then the number should also increase and vice-versa. 
    The range slider should be from 1 to 10 and also limit the number field from 1 to 10.
    When you click the Generate button, it should generate that many paragraphs of lorem ipsum or similar text.
    The styling should also be as per the screenshots.
