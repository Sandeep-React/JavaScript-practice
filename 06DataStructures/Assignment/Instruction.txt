1. Create a basic HTML structure for the banking application. This should include a form with select fields from account to account, 
input amount to transfer, and a button to submit the form. Additionally, create two sections to display the transaction history for each account.

2. Define the initial account balances as an object. Each account should have a balance and an empty array to hold transaction history.

3. Define a function to handle money transfers between accounts. This function should take the from account to account, 
and amount as parameters. Inside the function, check if both accounts exist and if the from account has enough balance 
to make the transfer. If the transfer is successful, update the account balances, add the transaction to both accounts, 
update the transaction history display, show a success message, and reset the transfer form.

4. Define a function to update the transaction history display for each account. This function should loop through all 
accounts and update the transaction history display for each account. It should first clear any existing transaction history 
and then loop through all transactions for the account and add them to the list.

5. Add an event listener to the form's submit button to handle form submissions. This event listener should prevent the default 
form submission behavior and instead call the transfer function with the form input values. Additionally, call the transaction 
history update function to update the transaction history display for both accounts.
